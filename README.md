# Package creator for Laravel 5 or 5.1

This Laravel package adds commands to Laravel's `artisan` tool. These commands allow for the easy creation of a sensible package structure within Laravel 5 or 5.1, in order to aid with initial internal package development and testing.

*Please note that this is in very early development and requires some tidying up and testing. It may not work in all configurations.*
